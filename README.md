# Physical-Interface-with-Raspi-Pico-and-MIDI-System
A modular system demonstrating how multiple Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller circuits can read inputs from buttons and switches and send MIDI signals to a central controller or computer. Designed for educational and personal projects, this repository illustrates techniques for  modular integrated circuit design, and MIDI communication via USB
